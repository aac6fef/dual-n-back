**Title: I developed a free, open-source Dual N-Back app for Desktop and Android to boost your working memory. Looking for feedback!**

Hey everyone,

For the past few months, I've been passionately working on a personal project: a clean, modern, and highly customizable Dual N-Back application. I've always been fascinated by cognitive training, and I wanted to create a tool that was not only effective but also free and accessible to everyone. Today, I'm excited to share it with you all!

**What is Dual N-Back?**
For those who might not know, the Dual N-Back task is a scientifically-backed brain training exercise. Consistent practice has been shown to improve working memory, attention, and even fluid intelligence. It involves tracking two separate streams of information (in this app, a flashing square's position and a spoken letter) and identifying when a stimulus matches one from 'N' steps back. It's challenging, but incredibly rewarding!

**My App's Key Features:**
*   **Completely Free & Open-Source**: No ads, no subscriptions. Just a tool for self-improvement.
*   **Cross-Platform**: Works natively on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**. An **Android** version is also available.
*   **Highly Customizable**: You can fine-tune everything—the N-Back level, speed, number of trials, and more—to create the perfect challenge for yourself.
*   **In-Depth Stats**: Track your progress with detailed session history, including beautiful charts for hit rate, false alarm rate, and difficulty progression over time.
*   **Modern & Clean UI**: Designed to be intuitive and distraction-free, so you can focus on your training.
*   **Multi-language support**: English and Chinese are supported.

**Platform & Download Info**

You can find the latest releases for all platforms on the GitHub releases page:

A quick note on iOS: Unfortunately, I don't have an Apple Developer account, so I can't officially release an iOS version on the App Store. However, for those of you who are tech-savvy, I've included the `.ipa` file in the GitHub releases. You're welcome to sideload it if you know how.

**I'd Love Your Feedback!**
This is a passion project, and I'm eager to make it better. I would be incredibly grateful if you could try it out and let me know what you think. Any feedback—bug reports, feature suggestions, or just your general experience—is welcome. You can open an issue on GitHub or just comment below.

Thanks for checking it out!
